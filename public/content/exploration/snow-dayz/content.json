  "description": "I have a habit of carving faces into snow features along the skin track — little companions to mark the day. On this particular outing, one of those shapes looked uncannily like a fish. Idea born! Using a mix of still photos, video, After Effects, and Kaiber AI, I decided to bring the snow fish to life. Things can get pretty weird out there in the snow dayz.",
