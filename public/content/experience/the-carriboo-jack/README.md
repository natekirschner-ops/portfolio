## Event Philosophy

The Carriboo Jack embodies the belief that the most meaningful adventures happen when we venture beyond the familiar. By combining challenging terrain with community spirit, the event creates an experience that transforms both the individual rider and the collective understanding of what mountain biking can be.

The race serves as a reminder that the wilderness is not just a backdrop for our activities, but a teacher, a challenge, and a source of profound connection. Each pedal stroke in the backcountry is an act of exploration, both of the landscape and of one's own capabilities.
